Let's admit, if she loves anything in this world more than me is chilli chatka. I can't understand how can a kurkure flavour make her happy so much.\n                                To be honest, I think if anyone ever fights with her and then just bring her a packet of this kurkure she will just forget everything and eat it like a small baby. Now you must be thinking ki ye toh exaggerate kiya hai\n                                , itna thodi na koi karta hai, let me tell you, her insta bio once was 'Chill Chatka'. I know, it makes no sense par mai kya karu, ye hai na aisi. But the thing is, I love this nature of her. She is such a cute baby ki choti\n                                choti cheezon me bhi itna khush hoti hai. I love her quality of finding happiness in every thing. I promise to always make you happy like this pack of chill chatka, or should I say I promise to be your packet of Chilli Chatka.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text'>\n\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-right\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The Swagger Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Swagger} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, look at that face...hahahahahahahahahahaha kya yar amisha bohot hi cool hai tu. Ok jokes apart, no not you amisha, the other jokes, tu ruk yahi, this picture is called as 'Bachpan se Cool' Amisha.\n                                I guess amisha jab paida hui thi toh even doctor said ki badhai ho, swagger hui hai. But you look very cute amisha. Where did you get those glasses from, rayban or fasttrack? Amisha does not care about what people say about her behind her\n                                or even her face. She has no time to listen to them because she is too busy to keep her swag always up. Amisha is the kind of person who will stand out of the crowd always. She likes to make her own identity. Even if she dresses up like other people\n                                there is something\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                            about her that makes her unique. Extremely confident and super interesting are the qualities she likes to carry with her. When I first met her, I knew there was something different about her. Couldn't understand then but I guess it\n                            was the fact that I will be spending my rest of life with her.\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-left\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The Dhakkan Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Dhakkan} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                This is actually the real amisha. She is this level of dhakkan. Amisha's thinks ki if you travel daily by train then you can bargain on the ticket price, 'Kya bhaiua roz toh jati hu isi train se, kuch toh kam karo'. Ok this might be\n                                an exaggeration but if I you were to ask me ki is amisha more beautiful or intelligent, I won't have words to describe how beautiful she is. But this quality of her actually makes her cute. You know when you tell her ki ye aise\n                                nahi waise hota hai, she will just look at you and say 'ha wahi na ek hi baat hai, tu samaj gaya na bas'. Yes mai toh samaj gaya Amisha, tune jo kaha wo bhi aur tune jo kaha nahi wo bhi mai samaj gaya. She might be dhakkan in some things\n                                but she is brilliant at a lot of things. Be it making anyone smile at any point\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                            in any situation, or making someone comfortable that they can keep their heart in front of her she can do that. She is someone who does not calculate relations, she is not with\n                            you because of anything. She is with you because of you and I feel the luckiest to have her for ever.\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-right\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>Dhinchak Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Dhinchak} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                Dhinchak Pooja? Oh she is just a student. The real dhinchak is here. Welcome to the crazy phase of amisha, which is like 80% of amisha. As I said, Amisha does not need a particular environment, keep her anywhere and she will rule it. \n                                Amisha is crazy, and by crazy I can't tell you how crazy. For that you will have to be on her snapchat list. If ever amisha decides to enter the meme making game, A lot of the players will be closing their shops. Amisha can sing, better \n                                and worst at the same time. She can start with being lata mangeshkar and she can go to become baba sehgal in like 0.01s. Amisha's original lyrics include Amisha Gyani, Khati aaloo peeti paani. Yes I have heard them from her mouth and trust\n                                me I was this close to killing myself. But again, she laughs on herself and the way \n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                            she laughs, will make you laugh. She does not want anyone to roast because she just self emulates. I love how she goes that extra mile to make someone feel better, not just me but even if you talked to her just once, she will care about your happiness.\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-up\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The Elegant Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Elegant} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                Ok toh ab tak I only talked about how free, how cool amisha is. But this does not mean ki she cannot handle the class look. Infact, she kills it even more when she decides to be the queen of elegance. I swear I just cannot take my eye off\n                                her even for a single second when she dresses up for a party. She looks so beautiful and she has such a great taste in clothing or makeup, that she just looks outstanding. Honestly, even while writing this I am mesmerized in thoughts of her\n                                and god I cannot stop imagining her. She is someone who can just by looking at you can tell you what will look good on you and what now. Just not the look, even if you talk about her way of carrying herself, you won't recognize that she is the\n                                same person who was wearing a \"apna time aayega\" tshirt thodi der pehle.

Amisha adores her family very much and she is too possessive for them. She respects her parents and she can do anything for her family and she won't think about a single time if she had to sacrifice anything \n                                for them. Her family comes before anything else for her. She tries to make her family proud in every way possible, be it winning the gold medal, or choosing the best person in the world as her boyfriend, amisha never lets her parents down.\n                                Yeah, why not, I am the best person okay. I remember when she won the gold medal, she was more happy about the fact that her father will get the opportunity to be with her on the stage and collect the award with her.
