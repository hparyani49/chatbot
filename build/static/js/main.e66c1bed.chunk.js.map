Let's admit, if she loves anything in this world more than me is chilli chatka. I can't understand how can a kurkure flavour make her happy so much.\n                                To be honest, I think if anyone ever fights with her and then just bring her a packet of this kurkure she will just forget everything and eat it like a small baby. Now you must be thinking ki ye toh exaggerate kiya hai\n                                , itna thodi na koi karta hai, let me tell you, her insta bio once was 'Chill Chatka'. I know, it makes no sense par mai kya karu, ye hai na aisi. But the thing is, I love this nature of her. She is such a cute baby ki choti\n                                choti cheezon me bhi itna khush hoti hai. I love her quality of finding happiness in every thing. I promise to always make you happy like this pack of chill chatka, or should I say I promise to be your packet of Chilli Chatka.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text'>\n\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-right\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The Swagger Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Swagger} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, look at that face...hahahahahahahahahahaha kya yar amisha bohot hi cool hai tu. Ok jokes apart, no not you amisha, the other jokes, tu ruk yahi, this picture is called as 'Bachpan se Cool' Amisha.\n                                I guess amisha jab paida hui thi toh even doctor said ki badhai ho, swagger hui hai. But you look very cute amisha. Where did you get those glasses from, rayban or fasttrack? Amisha does not care about what people say about her behind her\n                                or even her face. She has no time to listen to them because she is too busy to keep her swag always up. Amisha is the kind of person who will stand out of the crowd always. She likes to make her own identity. Even if she dresses up like other people\n                                there is something about her that makes her unique. Extremely confident and super interesting are the qualities she likes to carry with her. When I first met her, I knew there was something different about her. Couldn't understand then but I guess it\n                                was the fact that I will be spending my rest of life with her.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-left\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The Dhakkan Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Dhakkan} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                This is actually the real amisha. She is this level of dhakkan. Amisha's thinks ki if you travel daily by train then you can bargain on the ticket price, 'Kya bhaiua roz toh jati hu isi train se, kuch toh kam karo'. Ok this might be\n                                an exaggeration but if I you were to ask me ki is amisha more beautiful or intelligent, I won't have words to describe how beautiful she is. But this quality of her actually makes her cute. You know when you tell her ki ye aise\n                                nahi waise hota hai, she will just look at you and say 'ha wahi na ek hi baat hai, tu samaj gaya na bas'. Yes mai toh samaj gaya Amisha, tune jo kaha wo bhi aur tune jo kaha nahi wo bhi mai samaj gaya. She might be dhakkan in some things\n                                but she is brilliant at a lot of things. Be it making anyone smile at any point in any situation, or making someone comfortable that they can keep their heart in front of her she can do that. She is someone who does not calculate relations, \n                                she is not with you because of anything. She is with you because of you and I feel the luckiest to have her for ever.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-right\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>Dhinchak Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Dhinchak} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                Dhinchak Pooja? Oh she is just a student. The real dhinchak is here. Welcome to the crazy phase of amisha, which is like 80% of amisha. As I said, Amisha does not need a particular environment, keep her anywhere and she will rule it. \n                                Amisha is crazy, and by crazy I can't tell you how crazy. For that you will have to be on her snapchat list. If ever amisha decides to enter the meme making game, A lot of the players will be closing their shops. Amisha can sing, better \n                                and worst at the same time. She can start with being lata mangeshkar and she can go to become baba sehgal in like 0.01s. Amisha's original lyrics include Amisha Gyani, Khati aaloo peeti paani. Yes I have heard them from her mouth and trust\n                                me I was this close to killing myself. But again, she laughs on herself and the way she laughs, will make you laugh. She does not want anyone to roast because she just self emulates. I love how she goes that extra mile to make someone feel \n                                better, not just me but even if you talked to her just once, she will care about your happiness.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-up\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The Elegant Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Elegant} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                Ok toh ab tak I only talked about how free, how cool amisha is. But this does not mean ki she cannot handle the class look. Infact, she kills it even more when she decides to be the queen of elegance. I swear I just cannot take my eye off\n                                her even for a single second when she dresses up for a party. She looks so beautiful and she has such a great taste in clothing or makeup, that she just looks outstanding. Honestly, even while writing this I am mesmerized in thoughts of her\n                                and god I cannot stop imagining her. She is someone who can just by looking at you can tell you what will look good on you and what now. Just not the look, even if you talk about her way of carrying herself, you won't recognize that she is the\n                                same person who was wearing a \"apna time aayega\" tshirt thodi der pehle.

Amisha adores her family very much and she is too possessive for them. She respects her parents and she can do anything for her family and she won't think about a single time if she had to sacrifice anything \n                                for them. Her family comes before anything else for her. She tries to make her family proud in every way possible, be it winning the gold medal, or choosing the best person in the world as her boyfriend, amisha never lets her parents down.\n                                Yeah, why not, I am the best person okay. I remember when she won the gold medal, she was more happy about the fact that her father will get the opportunity to be with her on the stage and collect the award with her. She is very emotionaly\n                                when it comes to them and and not just them, her brother is like everything to her. I am glad to be a part of her family now.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-right\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>Hamari Gopu Bahu Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Gharelu} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                Okay I know this is like too much, but guys mai kya karu agar wo har role me rock karti hai tu.

Okay don't show this to any feminist and not that it matters but \n                                all I am trying to say is ki she is gopi bahu except the fact that she won't wash your laptop with soap. She wakes me up at any time I ask her. Doesn't matter what time she slept, she will wake you whenever you want. She knows the value of family \n                                relations so be it your dur ki chachi aur cousin wali masi, just one conversation is what amisha need to make them question their own daughter in laws. To be very honest, even if she someday wears an Indian Attire, the first thing that comes to your\n                                mind is ki 'Yar ye toh proper shadi material hai'. I don't need to worry about convincing my parents about her, instead they will convince me ki are you really sure that you are upto her standards.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-up\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The Kid Your Parents Warned You About</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Harami} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                If you are reading this and if you are one of amisha's parent or any other relative, you should not read ahead. Seriously, you wouldn't want to know this part about her. Amisha is like that person in the group who will take you to vegas and mix drugs in your\n                                drink, and the next morning you will wake up with a tiger in your bathroom. And when asked why she did that, she will just say carpe diem. Amisha loves pulling pranks on people and sometimes they can get pretty serious. Hon, I hope you are with me and this \n                                not one of your pranks where after 3 years you will say ki hitesh wo dekh camera usme hath hila de. Amisha likes to tease people to such an extent where you are just about to burst on her and suddenly you will realize ki ha yar ye wala funny toh tha. That \n                                is actually the thing about her, she is never laughing on you, she is always laughing with you. She knows her limits but sometimes she can forget them and can convince you to call your ex and say 'ek plate idli wada bhej dena'\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-left\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>The High Amisha</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={High} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                This is everything combined version of amisha. This is amisha when she is high. Don't ask high on what, she can get high on alcohol, or maybe just by the presence of her love (Me :p). Amisha when high is either everything or everything. Amisha is like the best person\n                                to chill with because you never have to worry about getting a bad hangover when she is around. You will always wake up feeling like you laughed more than you have laughed your entire life combined. I have been around when she was high and I couldn't just leave her for once\n                                second. Infact on the first date or whatever you call it we were high together. I can definitely say, it was the best time of my entire 2020. She is the best person if you have to take something off your chest when high, because she will listen to you and come with the \n                                perfect response to make you just let go everything that is troubling you. Basically, if you don't have prateek kuhad's music when high, you can talk to amisha, they are the same things.\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='about-text m-t-10'>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Reveal>\n                <Reveal effect=\"fade-in-right\">\n                    <h2 className='heading'>Us</h2>\n                    <div className='mission-holder'>\n                        <div className='image-text'>\n                            <img src={Us} className='image' />\n                            <div className='about-text'>\n                                ooohh maaa guuu, turu lob.....This is us. This is me with my world. Well I might be not as romantic as Jim, but I tried amisha. I tried to make u smile, which you do effortlessly. I tried to show you how special you are just like you make me feel everyday. I tried to make you\n                                remember all those beautiful moments in life, which for me are those spent with you. I tried to show you that you are surrounded by people who love you, and I am surrounded by the person who can love me like no one else can. What I want to say is, I thank you for everything that you\n                                have done for me and you still do with so ease, because honestly no matter how much I try, I cannot do as much as you do for me. I still remember when we were unsure about each other, and now we have come here where we can be unsure about anything but we are sure about us. \n                                This might not be the best gift to give you, but along with this, you get a Hitesh Premium membership for the rest of your life, In this pack, you get undivided attention from me, a special coupon for every 3 months by which you can me ask me for anything (I am sure you are excited about this)\n                                , weekly long text about how much I love you, a date every month for the rest of our life and in the end a promise to love you so much that even Pam will ask Jim to learn something from me. Dear Amisha Gyani, don't try hard to think of the best moment of your life, because every moment with me will \n                                be your best moment.
